# Modular Neuronal Networks

A little library that get's worked on every two years
for testing and implementing interesting NN stuff.

mnn/* is the library part,
the rest is a Qt project with some test and debug cases,
mainly training the MNIST Handwritten Digits set
and developing the Restricted Boltzman Machine.

Also a Qt gui project is included, which just started..

The whole thing is not polished at all and in development state.
Some things might even be totally wrong!
