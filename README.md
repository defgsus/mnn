# Modular Neuronal Networks

A little library that get's worked on every two years
for testing and implementing interesting NN stuff.

mnn/* is the library part,
the rest is a Qt project with some test and debug cases.

The whole thing is not polished at all.
Some things might even be totally wrong!
